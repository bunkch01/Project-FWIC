        Project FWIC, is an in-development tool, intended to provide digital aid to textual analysis. The 'FWIC' of Project FWIC 
        stands for Finding Words In Context, and this serves as a reasonable description of the tool's intended purpose. Project 
        FWIC will have two parts, the first, a web-based interface, offering reasonable functionality and accessibility, and the 
        second, a standalone application with enhanced functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first of the tools for Project FWIC to be worked on, the web-based interface, or 'FWIC WEB', is currently in 
        development. As of now, it has minimal functionality, and is capable only of listing the instances of a pre-defined 
        word, after searching through a pre-defined segment of text. As development progresses, this functionality will be 
        enhanced and expanded upon. To access the web tool in whatever its current state may be, use the link in the 
        navigation bar at the top of the page.
