Project FWIC
=============

Project FWIC, standing for Finding Words In Context, is an outgrowth of the Digital Humanities Research
 occuring at Luther College. The goal is to produce two tools, both Open Source, and optimized for class
 room use, to assist in digital textual analysis.

 
The Tools
-----------
 
One of the tools is intended to be a purely web-based one, for easy accessibility and use. This web based 
tool will be primarily coded in Javascript. This tool is also an initial first step towards the creation 
of a standalone application, with enhanced functionality.

The second tool, to be developed later, will be the standalone application mentioned earlier. This tool 
will feature a more complex and advanced set of capabilities, as well as a more useful GUI, and will be
 coded in Python.
